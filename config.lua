--- easily modifiable variables.
--- for true/false variables, just set them to one or the other in order to activate/deactivate the variables
--- for numerical variables, pick a number that makes sense.
SPAWN_ITEMS_AT_PLAYER = false -- if the items are dropped at the player or where the monster died
PERCENTAGE_SPAWN_CHANCE = 100 -- chance to spawn items. 100% is guaranteed item drop
SPAWN_ITEM_MAX = 1 -- if there's a chance to spawn items, this variable determines the maximum number of items spawned
SPAWN_LOCKED_ITEMS = true -- enemies can also drop items not unlocked yet.
